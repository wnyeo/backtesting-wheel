# QF101 Project

This project aims to test the strategies of 
1. buying and holding the S&P500
2. Selling Secured puts and Covered calls

trader1.py is the strategy for buying and holding <br>
trader2.py is the strategy for selling secured puts and covered calls <br>
getData.py are the helper functions for trader2.py <br>

To run the codes, either do a git clone or download the codes. <br>
place the data folder in the same directory as the codes. <br>
Run the strategies in an IDE or the terminal. 

Code runtime might exceed 5 mins since the code is done in a brute force manner.
